This database from Voronezh, Russia with 119 cows breed Black Angus. The dataset contains raw depth maps, RGB images, point clouds for left, right, and top views, matrices of transfomation (left to right) (the size of depth and RGB images are 512 × 424 and 1920 × 1080 pixels, respectively; point clouds were obtained taking into account the internal parameters of cameras). Also, the database also contains manual measurements, live weight of the body parameters, and aligned clouds. Soon we will prepare the content of vitamins and minerals, and genome-wide association studies for this database. This work was carried out in the project ("Development of new approaches to the lifetime assessment of cattle by 3-D visualization of economic, biological and genetic characteristics of animals”, the Russian Science Foundation, No. 21-76-20014, supervisor, 2021-2024).
